# VS Code Profile Switcher

VS Code Profile Switcher is a tool that allows the polyglot developers to have and manage multiple profiles within Visual Studio Code, each with its own configurations and extensions.

## Instalation

[Download](https://github.com/VitorBarleta/vscode-profile-switcher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the source code or clone the project in you machine through Git:
`git clone https://github.com/VitorBarleta/vscode-profile-switcher.git`.

With the source code downloaded proceed.

` cd vscode-profile-switcher && ./install.sh -i`.

In case you use the **Fish** shell, run the following instead:

`cd vscode-profile-switcher && ./install.sh -i -f`.

The installation process should be very fast and it is just going to copy the native shell script into the `$HOME/.local/bin` folder.
